# Reporter

Lumi allows you to integrate a reporter into your exported html files, which collects data and makes this data available in a downloadable\* file. The reporter is visible as a toolbar on top of the H5P content. After finishing the H5P content you can click on the arrow in the top right corner and download a `.lumi` file. This `.lumi` file contains these xAPI Statements, data and information about the user's actions and achievements. Students can send these `.lumi` files back to their instructor and the instructor can evaluate and analyze these reports with [Lumi Analytics](analytics.md).
